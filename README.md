# create_multiple_folders
creating multiple folders using python and excel

Since I need it at work I made a short script to create multiple folders. How does it work..

in excel file "name_of_folders", the folder names are entered in column A. <br />
Run python script main.py <br />
A folder named Folder will be created, and all your folders will be inside****
